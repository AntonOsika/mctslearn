# MCTS Learn
## Library for solving sequential decision problems with MCTS and ML

### Why this?

- Optimisation is often the hard part of real world problems, MCTS + ML can
be used as a a black box optimiser. The techniques behind the success of AlphaZero can be leveraged for applied problems!
- We often have a pretty good simulator for the real world which can be
leveraged for acting optimally without gathering data
- This framework will not assume that the environment is fully observable or
deterministic
- The code is written for any single or multiplayer openai gym environment
